# Week 3: DataViz with IIP

- [x] Static: using existing dataset, create **png file** painting a big picture of the overall Bollywood landscape:
- [ ] GIF: using existing dataset, create **gif file** showing evolution over the years

[final p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/Sahil_Agarwal/full/RDXYccwot)

- basic concept: see effect of number of words in a movie's title on several variables
- goals:
  - [x] comments: make the code understandable and clean (see siddhartha's code)
  - [x] variable coding: minimize constants; allow code to be altered freely
    - alter variables: let me change the variables around
    - alter number of variables: let me change number of charts
    - alter positions: let me change position of each chart
    - works on any screensize: define based on `windowWidth` and `windowHeight` instead of numbers
  - [x] use json: to seperate the required constants
  - [x] create functions: make each function do single task, opt for multiple functions (see vivek's credit)
  - [x] no trial-and-error: minimize trial and error; think beforehand
  - [ ] catchy title: can't seem to figure this one out
  - [x] incorporate images: to figure out how to position on page
- despite the final product being a png, wanted to focus on quality coding (since i haven't coded in a while), and creating code which could be mix-and-matched with ease.
- [ ] pending: add feature to input the desired variables in p5.js itself, when i'm free
