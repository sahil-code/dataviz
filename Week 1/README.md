# Week 1: DataViz with IIP

You have made an alien friend from Mars.
They are curious about your life. The catch is - they donâ€™t understand human text but do understand numbers, shapes, geometry, colors, symbols, and signs.
Create a data portrait that helps your alien friend understand some aspect of your life -
(ex. friendship / music taste / personality / habits / relationships / ambition)
Constrain: You have to include at least one data point that is qualitative, one that is quantitative.
